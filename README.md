# Sustainable Daily


## About the project
Sustainable Daily is designed to integrate sustinable activities into everyday life.

We aim to gamify the process of building sustainable habits through daily goals which give you points and levels. These can be used to unlock fun characters and accessories to enhance your profile.

<br>

### Home Page
On the home page the user is shown all of their daily tasks. These include randomised global tasks that everyone can complete to earn points and xp, aswell as personal tasks that don't earn the user anything.

Some examples of global tasks are minigames, quizes, surveys, and finding certain things such as water fountains and recycle bins.

<br>

### Profile Page
The proile page displays the user's name, level and points. There are different tabs for customising parts of a profile such as, username color, background color, character and accessories.

<br>

### Leaderboard Page
The leaderboard page displays mutliple leaderboards of users. A global leaderboard will show all users, along with their current level and points. User's may join private leaderboards via code sharing, to have the options of seeing only users that they choose. The list of users can be sorted by name, level and points by clicking the respective buttons.

### Login Page
